The only real way to find the `dwc:datasetName` term unless one already knows that it exists is to meticulously read the entire term list, which is kind of a lot.  It would be nice if there were, say, a \"Dataset\" section in the index that listed the `dwc:datasetName` field.

{"prompt": "Revisiting comments on dwc:recordedBy, dwc:identifiedBy, dwc:georeferencedBy ", "completion": "The comments on the above terms recommend the use of pipes ( `|` ) to separate the values in a list. I wish to raise an observation about this recommendation and urge that these comments be removed or replaced with something far less syntactically stringent. The root of my concern is whether or not purported items in a value for this term can in fact be cleanly represented as a list. My argument here is that no, they cannot. Forcing them into a list of units introduces unintended bias.\r\n\r\nAlthough none of these terms make any mention of verbatim (due in part to the philosophical rabbit holes that such a word has us tumble down), neither do they recommend that these terms convey the identity of people or organizations. Nonetheless, recommending that pipes be used to separate items in string as through they were a list does in fact nudge us down that path. Rarely, if ever would one see a pipe separating members of a team on a collecting label. Rarely, if ever would such values be expressed as seemingly formal Western structures as provided in the comment like `Oliver P. Pearson | Anita K. Pearson`. The recommendation in the comments for these terms gives the impression that values are best computed; some form of local disambiguation activity is advisable. None of the definitions or recommendations suggest that shared content here be factual representations. As a result, collection managers who use a relational data management systems may be less inclined to record what is written on a label because it's perceived as having little downstream value \u2013 the use of pipes suggests someone has a purpose for the contained parts who does not know how to deal with other separators \u2013  favouring instead the use of a computed name(s) held elsewhere in their system. This is a mistake.\r\n\r\nValues for `dwc:recordedBy` and `dwc:identifiedBy` should be absent any implicit statement about identity that artificial separator characters like pipes introduce. When presented with examples like, `Dr. & Mrs. John Smith` on a collector label, do we eschew the recommendation or do we construct it like, `Dr. Smith | Mrs. John Smith` or `Dr. John Smith | Mrs. John Smith` or `Dr. John Smith | Mrs. ? Smith` or `John Smith | ? Smith` or simply `John Smith` (it's all too common that the \"Mrs.\" is entirely dropped)? Do we construct an awkward group if there is such an object type in one's collection management system? All of these are perfectly possible, but their implementations and expressions depend on one's familiarity with Western names. Likewise, it would appear exceedingly bizarre to some if ampersands were arbitrarily replaced by pipes for the purposes of publishing data as `Dr. | Mrs. John Smith`. Note that all are semantically different from the original form, which are likely to result in differing disambiguation routines should these occur outside the walls of the collection management system. Similarly, there are many examples of collector names written in native languages on labels whose separators might be 'e' or other. Introduction of pipes in their place might sway a collection manager to use a canonical, managerial, transliterated/translated form of these names. In short, pipes introduce unintended, cultural bias when it is likely that their purpose was to remove such biases. If it is truly identity we wish to convey, we have the terms `dwc:recordedByID` and `dwc:identifiedByID` for this very purpose. So...I do not know what clarity of purpose pipes serve in the exchange of occurrence records that contain these two terms."}

{"prompt": "Recommendations on missing/unknown/not recorded data in Darwin Core", "completion": "This issue is inspired by Robert Mesibov's post in GBIF discourse - [The vexed question of missing data in Darwin Core](https://discourse.gbif.org/t/the-vexed-question-of-missing-data-in-darwin-core/3374). \r\nThe discussions on the [thread](https://discourse.gbif.org/t/the-vexed-question-of-missing-data-in-darwin-core/3374) and [Arctos](https://github.com/ArctosDB/arctos/discussions/4807) are very insightful. (Thank you!)\r\n\r\nIn the post, Bob mentioned:\r\n\r\n> The Darwin Core [recommendations](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms) don\u2019t provide a lot of guidance. The entry \u201cunknown\u201d is recommended when footprintSRS, geodeticDatum, verticalDatum or verbatimSRS isn\u2019t known. On the other hand, the recommendation for coordinateUncertaintyInMeters is Leave the value empty if the uncertainty is unknown, cannot be estimated, or is not applicable (because there are no coordinates).\r\n\r\n\r\nTake the term [geodeticDatum](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:geodeticDatum) for example. `unknown` and `not recorded` are recommended in different sources.\r\n\r\nFrom [Darwin Core Quick Reference Guide](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/)\r\n\r\n> Recommended best practice  is to use the EPSG code of the SRS, if known. Otherwise use a controlled  vocabulary for the name or code of the geodetic datum, if known.  Otherwise use a controlled vocabulary for the name or code of the  ellipsoid, if known. **If none of these is known, use the value `unknown`.**\r\n\r\nFrom [Georeferencing Best Practices](https://docs.gbif.org/georeferencing-best-practices/1.0/en/#coordinates-coordinate-reference-system)\r\n\r\n> It is thus recommended to record the EPSG code of the coordinate reference system if possible, otherwise, record the EPSG code of the datum if possible, otherwise, record the EPSG code of the ellipsoid. **If none of these can be determined from the coordinate source, record `\"not recorded\"`**\r\n\r\nSubsequently these recommendations affect downstream implementation such as:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/tdwg/bdq/issues/60\r\n- https://github.com/gbif/occurrence/issues/84\r\n\r\nHence I would appreciate if there will be a general guidelines on how to treat different scenario of NITS (Nothing Interesting To Say) in Darwin Core. I appreciate Bob's suggestion on how to treat missing data in his [post](https://discourse.gbif.org/t/the-vexed-question-of-missing-data-in-darwin-core/3374):\r\n\r\n> Here\u2019s a possible answer to the \u201cWhat to do with missing data?\u201d question, and it\u2019s one I regularly propose to the compilers whose Darwin Core data tables I audit: If a data item is missing, leave it blank. If you have a reason for the \"missingness\u2019, put it in a \u2026Remarks field.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"}

{"prompt": "Implement TDWG-managed version of Dublin Core borrowed terms", "completion": "This will eliminate manual editing of Dublin Core data that currently must be done in the rs.tdwg.org repo. See step 10 and 11 in the [build workflow](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/blob/master/build/README.md)\r\n\r\nfrom 2021-08-04 offline email:\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, here's what I'm thinking. We already mint IRIs for \"term lists\". In the case of TDWG-issued terms, the term list IRI is the same as the namespace IRI. See\r\nhttps://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/master/term-lists/term-lists.csv\r\nfor the full list.\r\n \r\nFor borrowed terms, there's an IRI for the term list in this form:\r\n \r\n```\r\nhttp://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/dc/    dc: terms borrowed by DwC\r\nhttp://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/dcterms/ dcterms: terms borrowed by DwC\r\nhttp://rs.tdwg.org/ac/dcterms/  dcterms: terms borrowed by AC\r\nhttp://rs.tdwg.org/ac/xmpRights/ XMP terms borrowed by AC\r\nhttp://rs.tdwg.org/ac/dwc/ DwC terms borrowed by AC\r\n ```\r\nThe first level subpath is the vocabulary that the term list is part of. The second level subpath represents the borrowed namespace and is usually the standard abbreviation used for it. So if one knows the pattern, one can know both the containing vocabulary and the borrowed namespace.\r\n \r\nWhat I would do is just follow the same pattern that we use for TDWG-minted terms: https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/master/README.md#patterns-versions\r\n \r\nHere is how I'd denote the July 15, 2021 version of dcterms:references:\r\n```\r\nhttp://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/dcterms/version/references-2021-07-15\r\n ```\r\n\r\nThe assertion we'd make that is questionable is:\r\n ```\r\n<http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/dcterms/version/references-2021-07-15> dcterms:isVersionOf <http://purl.org/dc/terms/references>.\r\n ```\r\n\r\nwhile a legitimate statement would be:\r\n``` \r\n<http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/history/#references-003> dcterms:isVersionOf <http://purl.org/dc/terms/references>.\r\n ```\r\nwith the subject being the DCMI-minted version.\r\n \r\nI'm not sure how illegitimate the questionable assertion actually is. I guess it depends on what you believe a \"version\" is. TDWG defines its own version model, so I guess we can just say that a version is whatever we want it to be. In any case, because this follows the same IRI patterns as for TDWG-minted terms, I think that all of the dereferencing would just work and the scripts would need only a minor tweak to make it work. There may be other ways to handle this but it's the first idea I've had that I think actually would work.\r\n```"}
